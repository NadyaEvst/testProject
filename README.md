# testProject
Project includes tests which can be run in such ways:
1. First, copy "driver" folder from src/main/resources to the disc C on your computer, 
I'm using chrome driver, it requires installed Chrome browser.
2. If you are using Intellij IDEA, import project there as gradle project and tests can be run using TestNG plugin.
3. Or run gradle with command "gradle test" in project derictory from cmd (You need to install gradle first).
